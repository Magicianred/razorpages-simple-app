# Welcome to **razorpages-simple-app**  

This is a base structure realized in **Razor Pages (asp net core and C#)**, **HTML** and **Bootstrap** for CSS rules.  
  
It is not necessary to have a database (like SQLServer or MySQL) in order to have a site with dynamic content.  
  
You can change the content by editing the json files and the markdown of the 'data' folder. *razorpages-simple-app* display them.
